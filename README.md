This is my first commit. Hours of work have went into figuring out how IDE's work, how things are done as I have had minimal exposure to technicalities as a math major. Thank you for reading!

#What I learnt
Learnt basic tracing concepts in lesson 1 with the overview of project, traces and runs. 'Decorated' functions with traceabela and tracked individual runs in langchain. Added new metadata statically and also at runtime

#What I tweaked
I changed up the prompt of the RAG slightly and also the questions asked (I tried to be funny)
