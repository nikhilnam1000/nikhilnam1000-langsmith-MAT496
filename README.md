This is my first commit. Hours of work have went into figuring out how IDE's work, how things are done as I have had minimal exposure to technicalities as a math major. Thank you for reading!

# Module 1
## Lesson 1
### What I learnt
Learnt basic tracing concepts in lesson 1 with the overview of project, traces and runs. 'Decorated' functions with traceabela and tracked individual runs in langchain. Added new metadata statically and also at runtime

### What I tweaked
I changed up the prompt of the RAG slightly and also the questions asked (I tried to be funny)
(See tracing_basics.py)

## Lesson 2
### What I Learnt
Learnt about the different types of runs, compared a default chain type run with an llm type run on langsmith. Added metadata fields to the llm run and customly rendered the llm runs for tool calling, streaming and retriever runs.

### What I tweaked
I slightly tweaked the inputs, didn't find much to tweak in the code elsewhere.
